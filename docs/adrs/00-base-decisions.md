# Base decisions
- AWS - most experience with it
- EKS for Kubernetes
- Terraform + Terragrunt for IaC and DRY environments
- RDS MySQL for managed database with automated backups
- Needs to run on free tier 
- Need to be able to deliver this in 2 days
- abuse AI for generation of content provide the prompts for inspection
- use the [terragrunt reference architecture as baseline](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/tree/main/prod/us-east-1/prod)
